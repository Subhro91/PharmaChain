# PharmaChain - Blockchain-Powered Drug Verification

PharmaChain is a full-stack application designed to combat the counterfeit drug industry by leveraging blockchain technology for transparent and immutable tracking of pharmaceuticals. It provides a secure platform for manufacturers to register their products and for pharmacists to verify the authenticity of medicines before they reach consumers.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Secure User Authentication:** Separate login and registration flows for Manufacturers and Pharmacists.
- **Blockchain Integration:** All medicine registrations and verifications are recorded as transactions on a secure blockchain, ensuring data integrity.
- **Medicine Registration:** Manufacturers can register new medicines with unique details like name and batch number, creating a permanent record on the blockchain.
- **Instant Verification:** Pharmacists can instantly verify a medicine's authenticity by searching its details.
- **Transparent Logging:** All verification activities are logged and publicly viewable, providing a transparent audit trail.
- **PDF Export:** Verification logs can be exported as a PDF for documentation and reporting.
- **Fully Responsive Design:** A clean and modern user interface that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
- A running instance of the backend server or the deployed backend URL.

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Subhro91/PharmaChain.git
    cd PharmaChain
    ```

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required npm packages.
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Frontend Development Server:**
    Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the local development server.
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    The application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4.  **Backend Setup:**
    (Instructions would be added here for setting up the backend server locally if applicable).

## ðŸš€ Deployment

The frontend of this application is configured for easy deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

### Deploying to Vercel

1.  Push your latest code to your GitHub repository.
2.  Go to your Vercel dashboard and create a new project by importing your GitHub repository.
3.  **Configure the project settings:**
    -   **Framework Preset:** Vercel should automatically detect **Create React App**.
    -   **Root Directory:** Set this to `frontend`.
4.  Click **Deploy**.

Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application, making it available at a public URL.
